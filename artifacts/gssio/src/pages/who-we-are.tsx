          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            We exist to empower communities, protect vulnerable populations, and advocate for sustainable policies on a global scale. Operating in over 140 countries, our staff and volunteers work tirelessly to deliver health, education, and economic programs where they are needed most.
          </p>
 
          <h2>Our History</h2>
          <p>
            What began as a coalition of independent researchers and field workers has grown into a major international NGO. Throughout the early 2000s, GSSIF pioneered community-managed water systems in sub-Saharan Africa. Today, we are a leading voice in global policy, advising governments and intergovernmental bodies on sustainable development goals.
